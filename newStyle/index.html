        <h3>Purpose of Project</h3>
        <p>
          cosm.os was my industrial design honours project. it was born out of a
          mix of my fascination with systems thinking, and my difficulty
          reconciling the positive community aspects of social media and the
          negative aspects
        </p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
          cosm.os Aim was to change how we look at social media, by extracting
          all of the human context leaving and abstract system, that placing
          that system into an interactive context so that it can be experimented
          with and observed.
