      <p>
        The Urban Courtyard is an urban housing concept that
        prioritises a mix of highly personal and shared
        spaces. Developed by Meegan Barone and Rupert Moore,
        The Urban Courtyard is a possible solution to the
        problems posed by increased urban population
        density, and modern ways of living.
