        <h3>Project Purpose</h3>

        <p>
          Cosm.os was my industrial design honours project. it was born out of a
          mix of my fascination with systems thinking, and my difficulty
          reconciling the positive community aspects of social media and the
          negative aspects
        </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>

        <p>
          Cosm.os aim was to change how we look at social media. Through
          depicting an abstract and interactive representation of social network
          systems cosm.os hopes to encourage us to examine how we see social
          media and our interactions with it
        </p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>

        <p>
          I developed a few different elements for this project this included
          two interactive objects, a digital system simulation, a projection
          table and two plinths to display the objects
        </p>

        <h3>Duration</h3>

        <p>Mar - Oct 2018</p>

        <h3>Links</h3>

          To enable people to experiment with social situations, communities,
          and identities, and by doing so develop insight into the social

        Completed during the first six weeks of the academic year, this
        experiment somewhat of a proof of concept of the idea of visually
        presenting social connections. Data was gathered in the form of a very
        light survey which presented participants with generated identities with
        a set of traits and asked them the simple question of whether they get
        along. This information was then collated together and presented using a
        “D3.js” based force node graph.

        The first experiment conducted under the umbrella of social simulation
        was the links and nodes experiment. This system revolved around the
        measurement of interactions and memory, and how that would affect future
        interactions. Participants could create their own identities to insert
        into the system as nodes and apply to them a set of behaviours which
        dictated how they moved about the space.

        The second experiment centred around the organisation of groups into
        discrete clusters which self-censored communication between its members
        and other clusters. The original premise of this was to mimic the
        communication methodology incorporated by the Mastodon social network
        platform.
